- Better UI
    - Explain controls
    - Arrow keys to move
    - Labels for variables vs constants
    - Different font
    - Outline > shadows
    - Add control for centering the camera
    - Make controls text rather than icon
    - Lowercase draw methods, or just `circle` and `line` ?
    - "Equations of motion"
    - Optimize the physics code: keep the equations of motions when only altering initial conditions or velocities
        - Same for hitting the reset button
    - Allow for changing of variables while the simulation is happening
        - Think about this: difference between initial values and current values
    - Do we want to show current values also somewhere?
    - Default light theme, but a nice one
    - Nicer colors
    - Allow for `theta`, `alpha`, etc. (automatically detect greek letters and render nicely)
    - Initialize some system initially (so that 'start' can be pressed)
    - Show error box next to render script when there is a rendering error

- draw.ts: draw methods for rendering script

- class Simulator
    - description
    - system
    - renderMethod
    - intervalID

- class System
    - containing the physics data: variables, constants, the lagrangian, etc.
